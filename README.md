<p><h1>Style Plan</h1></p>
<p>My website is blog. It doen't need to target specfic age or gender because I will write about myself. However, I need to attract them into my website so probably should use brighter color, variety of colorful usages, or good fonts. I think it doesn't necessary to use <b>bold</b> many times because it is not about News and I am not a journalist. However, web contents are super important to get more visitors so it might be better to work on formatting, eye-catching and idea itself.</p>
