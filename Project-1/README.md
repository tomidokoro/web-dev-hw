# My First README.md
Kazuya Tomidokoro

**First Project in this class is a bit complicated because when I installed Atom on my another laptop which is almost non-spaced for new files, I saw many errors on my screen such as a failure of downloading packages and completely white-blanked Atom.**

*However, today, I just tried again with my newest computer, Atom is perfectly working now.*

___

I may recommend people to check their computer's storages if there are any troubles with Atom.

1. Check Storage
2. Delate `non-used` files
3. Email if it still goes wrong

___

+ Make sure that you perfectly follow the instruction.

- Don't miss the assignments!

I have a pretty good job with this assignment. I think.

I still need to see the instruction to work this.
