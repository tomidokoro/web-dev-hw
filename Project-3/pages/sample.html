  <p><em>Hello,</em> this is <b>Kazuya!!</b> I just created this page and I am going to write my events and thoughts here. Today I see snow in the outside which beautifully covers the ground and makes "White Field!!" Some people say they don't want cold weather and hate snow but I am really strong at cold temperature and happy to see the white grounds!! Winter is here!!</p>
