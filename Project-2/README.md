<h1><b>README, PROJECT2</b></h1>


<p>Good to know more codes</p>
<p>I like the idea of taking memo while typing html.</p>
<p>This assignment is very complicated and spent long time but easily understandable instruction and fun.

<p>I know it is little bit hard to get into Web Designing because there are too many things to memorize, but I feel now little easier than the last week's assignment. This means I am claerly improving my skill as a Web Designer so very impressed.</p>

<p>HW-02, it is really useful resources that I learned in this week but they were little bit tough to create. I spent 5 hours to finish all of them. I like the resources such as button, subscription, grayed text and searching bar.</p>

<p>HW-03, Good to know about how to put inside/outside resources to my web page. However, it's little bit hard to find exactly the same instructions I prefer. Some videos contain more variety of toppings or foods than my Bibimbab so it is really depending. Now we have leanred many codes for HTML resources in this class, they are all very useful but hard to memorize. I really impressed my technique for web-design getting better, and I can type the codes much faster than the first time.</p>
